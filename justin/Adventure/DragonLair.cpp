	shortDescription = "Lair of a sleeping dragon. It guards a cellar door.";
	exploreStory = "You tiptoe around gently, not wanting to wake the fiery beast. Impossible but to notice the charred remains of some former occupants. Treasure pieces are scattered, but become more prevalent on the westerly edge of the room, near where the dragon sleeps. Stories say the dragon cannot be defeated with any solid objects of mankind. Greed is its greatest weakness.";
